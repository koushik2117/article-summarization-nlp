{"article": "The field of quantum computing has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with major technology companies and research institutions racing to build practical quantum processors. Unlike classical computers that use bits representing 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can exist in superposition, representing both states simultaneously. This property, along with entanglement and quantum interference, allows quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. Potential applications include drug discovery, materials science, cryptography, and optimisation problems in logistics and supply chain management. However, current quantum computers are noisy and error-prone, requiring advances in error correction and qubit stability before they can tackle real-world problems at scale.", "summary": "Quantum computing leverages qubits, superposition, and entanglement to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, with promising applications in drug discovery, cryptography, and logistics, though noise and error correction remain key hurdles."}

{"article": "The global food system faces enormous challenges in feeding a growing population while minimising environmental impact. Agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a leading driver of deforestation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Sustainable farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture, precision farming, and vertical farming, offer pathways to produce more food with fewer resources. Plant-based proteins and lab-grown meat are emerging as alternatives to conventional animal agriculture, which is particularly resource-intensive. Reducing food waste, which amounts to approximately one-third of all food produced globally, is another critical lever. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated action from policymakers, producers, and consumers to create a food system that is both nutritious and sustainable.", "summary": "The global food system must balance feeding a growing population with reducing its environmental footprint through sustainable farming, alternative proteins, and food waste reduction, requiring coordinated effort from policymakers, producers, and consumers."}
